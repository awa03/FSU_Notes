<h1>Project 1: Enhanced wc program</h1>
</center>

<center><h2>Due: September 22, 11:59pm</h2></center>

<P>
  <b>Educational Objectives:</b>
Apply C++ knowledge for problem solving; 
experience text processing techniques; 
experience using the makefile to organize and compile applications.
</P>

<p>
  <strong>Statement of Work:</strong> Develop an enhanced <em>wc</em>
  program that collects the usage statistics of characters and words
  in a file (redirected as the standard input). 
<p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Project Requirement: </b>
</p>
<p>
The <em>wc</em> program is a UNIX utility that counts the numbers of lines,
words, and characters in a text file. Try "wc < filename" in a UNIX system
to see how wc behaves. In this assignment, you will develop an enhanced wc 
program that no only counts the numbers of lines, words, and characters, 
but also collects (and outputs) the usage statistics of characters,
words, and numbers in the file. 

<p>

The program should read the input until it reaches the end, keeping track of 
the numbers of lines, words, and characters while counting 
the number of times each character/word is used. 
A word can either be an identifier or a number. An identifier is defined as a
  letter followed by a sequence of letters or digits('a'..'z', 'A'..'Z',
  or '0'..'9'). Identifiers are case insensitive ("AA00", "Aa00", "aA00",
  and "aa00" are considered the same). A number is defined as a sequence of digits
  ('0'..'9') that are not in an identifier. Different sequences
  represent different numbers. For example, number "001" is different
  from number "1". Identifiers are separated by non-letter and non-digit
  characters. Numbers are separated by words or other non-letter and
  non-digit characters. 
<p>
  Your program should record the number of times each 
  identifier/number/character happens. It should first output the number 
of lines, words, and characters in the file. After that, it should output 
up to five most used characters,  up to five most used identifiers, and 
up to five most used numbers as well as the number of times these 
characters/identifiers/numbers are used.
Since identifiers are case insensitive, the program only outputs identifiers 
with lower case letters.
The characters, numbers and identifiers should be outputted in the descending 
order based on the number of times they are used. When two characters 
happen the same number of times, 
the character with a smaller ASCII value should be considered as being 
used more frequently. When two identifiers (or numbers) happen the same number 
of times, the identifier (number) that occurs earlier in the input should be 
considered as being used more frequently. 
An example executable (for the <tt>linprog</tt> machines) 'proj1.x' is 
provided in the supplied program files. You should make the outputs of your 
program the same as those of 'proj1.x'. When printing characters,
use '\t' for tab and '\n' for newline. All other letters should be 
outputted normally as they are.
<p>

<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Turn in files <tt>proj1.cpp</tt>
and <tt>makefile</tt> in a single tar file online via Canvas. When the two files
(<tt>proj1.cpp</tt> and <tt>makefile</tt>) are placed in the same directory on linprog, 
type 'make' should produce the executable 'proj1.x'.
<p>
<b> Grading:</b>
<ul> 
<li> Type 'make' in the subdirectory containing your submitted files 
should produce the executable <tt>proj1.x</tt>. If the program or makefile has any 
kind of (compiling) errors, no more than 10 points will be awarded. 
A program written in a language other than C++ will receive 0 point.</li>
<li><tt>proj1.x</tt> is successfully produced (15 points).</li>
<li><tt>proj1.x</tt> outputs line, word, and character counts correctly for 
simple small files (up to 2 lines, 10 words, 50 characters) (30 points).</li>
<li><tt>proj1.x</tt> outputs character usage correctly for 
simple small files (10 points).</li>
<li><tt>proj1.x</tt> outputs identifier usage correctly for 
simple small files (10 points).</li>
<li><tt>proj1.x</tt> outputs number usage correctly for 
simple small files (10 points).</li>
<li><tt>proj1.x</tt> outputs line, word, and character counts correctly for 
any file. The program earns these points only after it passes all testings                 with small files. (10 points). </li>
<li><tt>proj1.x</tt> outputs character usage correctly for any file.
The program earns these points only after it passes all testings                  
with small files.
 (5 points).</li>
<li><tt>proj1.x</tt> outputs identifier usage correctly for 
any file. 
The program earns these points only after it passes all testings                  
with small files. (5 points).</li>
<li><tt>proj1.x</tt> outputs number usage correctly for 
any file. The program earns these points only after it passes 
all testings with small files. (5 points).</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Extra credits:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first student who reports a new bug in the provided 'proj1.x' will
get an extra of 5 points for the assignment.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
</p>

<UL>
<li> You can assume that the total number of different words used in a file is 
less than 25000 and the number of characters in a word is less than 200.</li>

<li> Due to our own definition of word, our program's word count may be 
different from the word count from wc (line count and character count 
should be the same). </li>

<li>You can start by counting the usage of characters, and outputting the most
used characters. The same logic can be applied to count and output 
the usage of identifiers and numbers.
</li>

<li>You should make sure that your program produces exactly the same output 
as the provided <tt>proj1.x</tt> for all testing files provided. It would be a good idea
to create a few testing files of your own. In grading, more testing cases will be 
used.</li>
</UL>
<p>
<b>Miscellaneous:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>All programs handed in will be checked by automatic plagiarism 
detection software.
</li>
</ul>
