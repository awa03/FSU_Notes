This repository is a compilation of my notes from Florida State University. Within this compilation I explore every aspect of computer science. Sections currently under work will be updated promptly. These Notes are not meant to provide benifit to any party, rather to be used as a resource for personal use. Per FSU Guidelines these notes should not be bought nor sold. If any proffessor feels that this is a violation of their course policies please contact awa22@fsu.edu


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The majority of this information is from learning in class, therefore non of this information is strictly my own. For Credits all of the course teachers names will be cited. 


> [!NOTE]
> This repository is now depricated. New Notes will be posted to [Repo Link](). Thank you for your understanding. For now this repository stands to encompass notes from Spring 2023 - Mid Spring 2024. This change has been made to course issues in seperating material. Rather than modify existing information I will be creating a more wiki like setup for notes.
